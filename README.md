## Database Breakdown
!['our database setup'](https://github.com/Maskedspade/DoodleDoop/blob/master/docs/data-structure.png)
This is our database Setup.

Database Migrations:
1. Create 'Users' table
2. Create 'Events' table 
3. Create 'Timeslots' table
4. Create 'Respondents' table

Logic: One-to-many Relations
  - Each user can have multiple events.
  - Each event can have multiple timeslots -> We store users' choice + a by default it generates a "NOT GOING" timeslot to keep track of the number of people going on certain times/not going.
  - Each Timeslots can have multiple respondents.

## Project Showcase

!['Login from Home'](https://github.com/Maskedspade/DoodleDoop/blob/master/docs/Login'.gif)
Logging in fro.m the home page -> starts a cookie session and shows all current user's created events.

!['Creating new events'](https://github.com/Maskedspade/DoodleDoop/blob/master/docs/create-new-event.gif)
Create new events, options include inputting strings and use of a calendar select date and time API.
